# Factors Affecting Azure Costs

Azure operates on an **Operational Expense (OpEx)** model, where you pay for resources as you use them. Costs in Azure can vary based on several factors:


## 1. **Resource Type**
- **Impact**: The type of resource, its settings, and the region where it is deployed influence costs.
- **Examples**:
  - **Storage**: Costs depend on type (blob, file), performance tier, access tier, redundancy, and region.
  - **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Costs depend on OS licensing, CPU cores, attached storage, and network interfaces.


## 2. **Consumption**
- **Pay-as-You-Go**: Pay for what you use during a billing cycle. Flexible but can lead to higher costs with increased usage.
- **Reserved Capacity**: Commit to usage over 1 or 3 years to receive significant discounts (up to 72%). Ideal for consistent workloads.


## 3. **Maintenance**
- **Impact**: Unused or forgotten resources (e.g., storage linked to a deprovisioned VM) can incur additional costs.
- **Tip**: Regularly audit resources to ensure they are actively needed.


## 4. **Geography**
- **Global Pricing Differences**:
  - Costs vary by region due to power, labor, taxes, and fees.
  - Deploy resources close to customers for better performance but consider regional cost differences.
- **Network Traffic**:
  - Inbound data is often free; outbound data is charged based on billing zones.
  - **Zones**: Geographic groupings of Azure regions for pricing.


## 5. **Subscription Type**
- **Impact**:
  - **Free Trial**: Includes access to some free products for 12 months and initial credit for the first 30 days.
  - **Standard Subscriptions**: May include usage allowances depending on the type.


## 6. **Azure Marketplace**
- **Third-Party Solutions**:
  - Additional costs for vendor services, such as pre-configured servers, managed network appliances, or connectors to external services.
  - Billing is determined by the vendor and adds to Azure service charges.
- **Certification**: All solutions are certified to meet Azure policies.


## Additional Notes
- **Bandwidth**: Pricing for data transfer depends on the region (zone-based pricing).
- **Savings Tip**: Use resource groups, monitoring tools, and reserved capacity to optimize and reduce costs.

Understanding these factors can help you plan and manage your Azure costs effectively.
