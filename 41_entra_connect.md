# Connect Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Entra Connect

Microsoft Entra Connect is a tool that allows organizations to integrate their on-premises Active Directory (AD) with **Microsoft Entra ID** (Azure AD). By using this tool, companies can create a hybrid identity environment, where users and groups from their on-premises AD are synchronized with Microsoft Entra ID, enabling a seamless experience for accessing Microsoft 365, Azure, and other cloud-based applications.


## Key Components of Microsoft Entra Connect

Microsoft Entra Connect consists of several components that work together to provide synchronization and authentication between on-premises AD and Microsoft Entra ID:

### 1. **Sync Services**
   - **Role**: Synchronizes users, groups, and other objects between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Ensures identity data is consistent across both environments.

### 2. **Health Monitoring**
   - **Role**: Provides health monitoring for the synchronization process.
   - Available in the **Microsoft Entra Connect Health** portal, which allows administrators to monitor and troubleshoot synchronization issues.

### 3. **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**
   - **Role**: Optional component that can be used to configure a hybrid environment with on-premises federation for advanced scenarios.
   - Supports features like domain-join Single Sign-On (SSO), enforcement of AD sign-in policies, and multifactor authentication with smart cards.

### 4. **Password Hash Synchronization**
   - **Role**: Synchronizes a hash of a user's on-premises AD password with Microsoft Entra ID for cloud-based authentication.
   - **Benefit**: Allows users to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID services using the same password they use for on-premises applications.

### 5. **Pass-Through Authentication**
   - **Role**: Enables users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same password.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces IT support costs, as users donâ€™t have to remember multiple passwords. It also ensures security policies for passwords are enforced on-premises.


## Benefits of Microsoft Entra Connect

Integrating your on-premises AD with Microsoft Entra ID provides several benefits:

1. **Unified Identity**: Users can use a single identity to access both on-premises and cloud applications, such as Microsoft 365 and other SaaS applications.

2. **Simplified Management**: One tool (Microsoft Entra Connect) simplifies the management of synchronization and sign-in between on-premises AD and cloud environments.

3. **Access to New Features**: Microsoft Entra Connect is the modern solution for identity integration, replacing older tools like **DirSync** and **Azure AD Sync**, providing access to new features and capabilities for hybrid identity management.

4. **Security and Compliance**: Microsoft Entra Connect supports security features like **multi-factor authentication**, and allows organizations to enforce on-premises password policies while integrating with cloud services.


## Installation and Configuration

### Installation Considerations

Before installing **Microsoft Entra Connect**, you need to plan your deployment. Considerations include:

- **Choosing the Authentication Method**: Decide whether you will use **Password Hash Synchronization** or **Pass-Through Authentication** based on your organization's requirements.
- **On-Premises AD Requirements**: Ensure your on-premises Active Directory meets the requirements for synchronization.
- **Azure AD Subscription**: Ensure that you have the necessary Azure AD subscription level to support hybrid identities.

### Step-by-Step Guide

Microsoft provides an [installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-prepare) that walks you through the entire process, including:

1. **Preparation**: Ensure prerequisites are met, such as setting up accounts with the right permissions in both environments.
2. **Installation**: Download and install Microsoft Entra Connect on a server that can communicate with both your on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.
3. **Configuration**: Configure synchronization settings, choose your authentication method, and start the synchronization process.
4. **Testing**: After installation, verify synchronization between on-premises AD and Microsoft Entra ID.


## Conclusion

Microsoft Entra Connect helps organizations create a hybrid identity environment by synchronizing on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID. By integrating your on-premises directory with Azure, users benefit from a unified sign-on experience for both cloud and on-premises resources, while administrators can efficiently manage identities from a single location.

If you're transitioning to a hybrid or cloud-first environment, using **Microsoft Entra Connect** provides a streamlined approach to identity management and security.
