# Microsoft Defender for Cloud

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is a comprehensive monitoring tool designed for **security posture management** and **threat protection**. It provides continuous security monitoring, guidance, and notifications to help strengthen the security posture of cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud environments.

## Key Features and Benefits

Defender for Cloud enables you to:
- **Harden resources** across your cloud environments.
- **Track your security posture** with continuous assessments.
- **Protect against cyber threats** with proactive threat detection.
- **Streamline security management** across hybrid and multicloud deployments.

### Protection Everywhere Youâ€™re Deployed

Being an **Azure-native service**, Defender for Cloud automatically monitors and protects many Azure services without requiring additional deployment. For **hybrid** and **multicloud environments**, it can extend monitoring capabilities using **Azure Arc** and automatically deploy **Log Analytics agents** to gather security-related data.

- **Azure-native protections** for PaaS services like Azure App Service, SQL, and Storage Account.
- **Non-Azure environments** can be monitored via Azure Arc, extending Defender for Cloud's security features to servers outside of Azure.

### Azure-Native Protections

Defender for Cloud provides integrated protection for various Azure services:
- **Azure PaaS services**: Detects threats in services like Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Storage, and more.
- **Azure Data Services**: Classifies data in Azure SQL and identifies vulnerabilities, offering mitigation recommendations.
- **Network Protections**: Limits exposure to threats such as brute force attacks by controlling access to virtual machine ports and using just-in-time VM access.

### Defend Your Hybrid and Multicloud Resources

Defender for Cloud can be extended to non-Azure resources, protecting servers running on **on-premises** machines, and **AWS** or **Google Cloud** environments:
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Defender for Cloud integrates with AWS to offer **CSPM features** and **security assessments** according to AWS-specific guidelines (e.g., **AWS CIS**, **PCI DSS**).
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Defender for Cloud provides similar protections for GCP resources.
- **Defender for Containers**: Extends threat detection to containerized workloads, such as **Amazon EKS** clusters.

## Assess, Secure, and Defend

Defender for Cloud operates under a three-pronged approach:

1. **Continuously Assess**: Monitor your security posture with detailed vulnerability assessments across resources.
2. **Secure**: Harden your environment using best practices like the **Azure Security Benchmark**.
3. **Defend**: Detect and mitigate threats with advanced protection features.

### Continuously Assess

Defender for Cloud provides continuous security assessments for:
- **Virtual Machines** (VMs)
- **Container Registries**
- **SQL Servers**

Integration with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** enables **vulnerability findings** from **threat and vulnerability management** to be incorporated into your overall security assessment.

### Secure

To maintain a secure environment, Defender for Cloud leverages policies based on **Azure Policy**. It ensures that resources are aligned with **security best practices** and configurations.
- **Security policies** are automatically applied to new resources, helping to reduce the attack surface.
- **Secure score**: A scoring system helps you track your security posture and improve compliance by following recommendations.

**Azure Security Benchmark** provides a set of recommended security practices tailored for Azure services and compliance frameworks.

### Defend

Defender for Cloud also helps you **defend** your environment through real-time security alerts and advanced threat protection capabilities:
- **Security Alerts**: Detected threats generate alerts that describe the affected resources, suggest remediation actions, and can trigger automated responses.
- **Advanced Threat Protection**: Provides real-time protection for virtual machines, containers, databases, web applications, and networks. Key features include **just-in-time access** for VMs and **adaptive application controls** for securing running applications.

Defender for Cloud integrates with **fusion kill-chain analysis** to provide a deeper understanding of attack campaigns and their impact across your environment.

## Conclusion

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is an essential tool for continuously monitoring, securing, and defending your resources in the cloud, on-premises, and across hybrid or multicloud environments. Its deep integration with Azure services, as well as extended protections for non-Azure environments, ensures that your resources are always protected against evolving threats.
