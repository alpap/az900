# Azure ExpressRoute

Azure **ExpressRoute** is a service that allows you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud through a private, dedicated connection. This private connection is facilitated through a connectivity provider, creating what is known as an **ExpressRoute Circuit**. ExpressRoute enables you to connect various facilities like offices, data centers, or other locations directly to Microsoft cloud services like **Microsoft Azure** and **Microsoft 365**, bypassing the public internet for improved security and performance.

## Features and Benefits of ExpressRoute

There are several key benefits to using ExpressRoute to connect Azure with your on-premises networks:

- **Direct Connectivity to Microsoft Cloud Services**: Connect directly to services like Microsoft **Office 365**, **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and **Azure compute services** (e.g., Virtual Machines, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Storage).
- **Global Connectivity**: ExpressRoute Global Reach allows you to connect multiple locations (e.g., data centers in different regions) via ExpressRoute circuits, enabling private communication across regions.
- **Dynamic Routing via BGP**: ExpressRoute uses **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** for dynamic routing between your on-premises network and Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure.
- **Built-in Redundancy**: ExpressRoute circuits come with built-in redundancy in every peering location, ensuring higher reliability and uptime.

## Connectivity to Microsoft Cloud Services

ExpressRoute provides direct access to a variety of Microsoft cloud services across all regions, including:

- **Microsoft Office 365**
- **Microsoft Dynamics 365**
- **Azure compute services** like Virtual Machines
- **Azure cloud services** such as **Azure Cosmos DB** and **Azure Storage**

## Global Connectivity

With **ExpressRoute Global Reach**, you can connect different ExpressRoute circuits across your on-premises sites. For example, if you have an office in **Asia** and a data center in **Europe**, both connected to the Microsoft network through ExpressRoute circuits, you can enable communication between these locations through ExpressRoute Global Reach. This ensures data can travel securely without relying on the public internet.

## Dynamic Routing

ExpressRoute leverages **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol) for dynamic routing. BGP exchanges routing information between your on-premises network and Microsoft’s cloud resources, allowing automatic updates and optimal routing paths.

## Built-in Redundancy

To ensure high availability and reliability, ExpressRoute circuits include redundancy at every peering location. You can configure multiple circuits to enhance this redundancy and improve resilience.

## ExpressRoute Connectivity Models

ExpressRoute offers several connectivity models to help you establish secure, high-performance connections to Microsoft’s cloud:

1. **CloudExchange Colocation**: This model involves physically colocating your data center, office, or facility at a cloud exchange (e.g., an ISP). From there, you can establish a virtual cross-connect to the Microsoft cloud.

2. **Point-to-Point Ethernet Connection**: This involves using a point-to-point Ethernet connection to link your facility directly to Microsoft’s cloud.

3. **Any-to-Any Networks**: This model connects your **wide area network (WAN)** to Azure, allowing your office locations and data centers to connect to Azure as if they were part of your local network.

4. **Directly from ExpressRoute Sites**: You can connect directly into Microsoft’s global network at one of the strategically distributed peering locations around the world. This model supports **Active/Active** connectivity at scale with dual 100 Gbps or 10 Gbps connections via **ExpressRoute Direct**.

## Security Considerations

Because ExpressRoute doesn’t use the public internet, your data travels over a private, dedicated connection, significantly reducing security risks associated with internet traffic. However, there are still some elements, such as **DNS queries**, **certificate revocation list checks**, and **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)** requests, that will travel over the public internet even if you have an ExpressRoute connection.

## Summary

Azure **ExpressRoute** offers a private, secure, and high-performance connection between your on-premises network and Azure cloud services. It enhances reliability and security by avoiding the public internet, while enabling global connectivity, dynamic routing, and built-in redundancy. With multiple connectivity models, you can select the most suitable option for your infrastructure needs.
