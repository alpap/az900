# Zero Trust Model

The **Zero Trust** security model is built on the assumption that a breach has already occurred or is imminent, and that no one—whether inside or outside the network—can be trusted by default. This model continuously verifies and enforces access controls to protect resources, regardless of the user's location or the device being used.

In the modern computing environment, where employees are increasingly mobile, resources are spread across multiple locations, and security threats are more sophisticated, Zero Trust offers an adaptive and comprehensive approach to security.

## Core Principles of Zero Trust

Microsoft recommends adopting the **Zero Trust** security model, which is based on three key principles:

### 1. **Verify Explicitly**
   Always authenticate and authorize access based on **all available data points**. This includes verifying the identity of the user, the device they are using, and the context of their access request (e.g., location, time, behavior patterns).

### 2. **Use Least Privilege Access**
   Limit user access to the bare minimum required for them to complete their tasks. This principle includes using **Just-In-Time** (JIT) and **Just-Enough-Access** (JEA), **risk-based adaptive policies**, and ensuring **data protection**. This minimizes the potential damage from compromised credentials.

### 3. **Assume Breach**
   Always assume that an attacker has already gained access to the network. To limit the impact of a breach, use techniques such as:
   - **Minimizing blast radius**: Restricting access to critical resources.
   - **End-to-end encryption**: Ensuring that data remains secure even if it’s intercepted.
   - **Analytics**: Monitoring and analyzing network activity to identify threats and improve defenses.

## Adjusting to Zero Trust

Historically, corporate networks were built on the assumption that everything inside the network was safe. This assumption led to tight controls on VPN access and allowed only managed devices to connect to the network.

The **Zero Trust** model flips this approach. Rather than assuming a device or network is inherently safe, **Zero Trust requires continuous authentication** for every user and device. Access to resources is granted based on strict verification of identity, context, and device health, rather than just the network location.

This shift ensures that access is always verified and that sensitive resources are better protected against both external and internal threats.
