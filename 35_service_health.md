# Azure Service Health

## Purpose

**Azure Service Health** is a comprehensive service designed to keep you informed about the status of Azure resources, providing insights into both the **global Azure infrastructure** and the **health of your specific resources**. By combining multiple health monitoring services, Azure Service Health ensures you stay updated on incidents, planned maintenance, and other resource-impacting events.


## Components of Azure Service Health

   - Best for understanding incidents with **broad impact** affecting Azure infrastructure globally.

2. **Service Health**
   - Focuses on Azure **services and regions** that your organization is using.
   - Authenticated access ensures tailored updates about outages, maintenance, and health advisories for your specific services.
   - Includes the ability to configure **alerts** for proactive notifications about service-impacting events.

3. **Resource Health**
   - Provides a **tailored view** of the health of individual Azure resources, such as virtual machines or storage accounts.
   - Integrated with **Azure Monitor**, it allows you to configure alerts for resource availability changes.
   - Ensures detailed tracking of issues specific to your deployed resources.
