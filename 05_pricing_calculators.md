# Comparing the Azure Pricing and TCO Calculators

The **Pricing Calculator** and **TCO Calculator** are both tools to estimate costs in Azure, but they serve very different purposes.


## 1. **Pricing Calculator**
- **Purpose**: Estimates the cost of provisioning resources in Azure.
- **Usage**:
  - Allows you to configure individual resources, build a solution, or explore example scenarios.
  - Provides an estimate of Azure expenses based on resources like compute, storage, and networking.
- **Key Features**:
  - You can adjust settings for different resources (e.g., VM size, storage type, access tiers, redundancy).
  - Offers an estimated cost for each resource, but does not provision anything.
  - **Important**: Itâ€™s only for information purposes; no actual provisioning occurs, and no charges are incurred.
- **Example Use Case**: Estimating the cost of a new Azure VM and storage setup.


## 2. **TCO Calculator**
- **Purpose**: Compares the cost of running on-premises infrastructure to running the same environment in Azure.
- **Usage**:
  - You enter your current on-premises infrastructure configuration (e.g., servers, storage, network) and associated costs (power, IT labor).
  - The tool then estimates the cost difference between continuing to run on-premises or migrating to Azure.
- **Key Features**:
  - Factors in both direct infrastructure costs (servers, databases) and indirect costs (energy, maintenance, IT staff).
  - Provides an estimation of cost savings when switching from on-premises to Azure cloud.
- **Example Use Case**: Evaluating the financial benefits of migrating an existing data center to Azure.


## Key Differences
- **Focus**:
  - **Pricing Calculator**: Focuses on Azure resource provisioning and estimating cloud expenses.
  - **TCO Calculator**: Focuses on comparing on-premises costs with Azure costs for the same infrastructure setup.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Pricing Calculator**: Helps estimate the cost of new Azure deployments.
  - **TCO Calculator**: Helps determine the potential savings or cost differences when migrating from on-premises infrastructure to Azure.
